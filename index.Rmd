## About
I am a postdoctoral fellow at the the University of Texas at Austin. I have recently graduated as a PhD in Business Economics at [Insper](https://www.insper.edu.br/en/) where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Hedibert Lopes](https://hedibert.org/). For the first semester of 2023, I was a visiting scholar at the [School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences](https://math.asu.edu/) at Arizona State University working with [Dr. Richard Hahn](https://math.la.asu.edu/~prhahn/).
